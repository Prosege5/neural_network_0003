# Project info for 0003
- goal: train a network for a simple fruit classification dataset
- setup a framework for creating and training networks
- layed out code to be filled in (WIP)

# Learning Updates:
- Day 4: Stepping back and learning more
[file: /testing/nodes]
Today I stepped back to learn more about how to structure and plan a program in Rust.
I can make neurons with dynamic weight vectors based on input vec size.
Generating initial random weights and biases function
Feed forward functionality, no activation yet.
Saving a "model" to a .json file.
Loading a "model" from a .json to create a new neuron.
